Local install -------------  First of all, if you're seeing the message **'system folder missing'** after launching your browser, then that means you have cloned the repository and have not built the project properly.  1. Dowload the latest [stable release](https://github.com/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/releases) from github or [unstable build](https://bintray.com/jekkos/opensourcepos/opensourcepos/view/files?sort=updated&amp;order=asc#files) from bintray. A regular repository clone will not work unless you are brave enough to build the whole project! 2. Create/locate a new mysql database to install open source point of sale into 3. Execute the file database/database.sql to create the tables needed 4. unzip and upload Open Source Point of Sale files to web server 5. Modify application/config/database.php and modify credentials if needed to connect to your database 6. Modify application/config/config.php encryption key with your own 7. Go to your point of sale install public dir via the browser 8. LOGIN using   * username: admin    * password: pointofsale 9. Enjoy 10. Oops an issue?
